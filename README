I just uploaded this for review now -- it is missing some dependencies for getting it working. In the near future I'll get the complete project up. 

In a nutshell this program (written in java (my first large java/OO program)) provides a graphical environment as an alternative to scripting Qlikview applications. I have used this with success to build prototypes in minutes, debug large applications, and build complete applications as this incorporates alot of the functionality of Qliktech's scripting language.
